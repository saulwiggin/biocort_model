biocort_model
=============
This is a model written in matlab for the analysis of a metamaterial lens with a gradient index as a function of x and y axis. The calculation is based on a model by Biocort et al for caluclating the seidel aberrations in a gradient index lens using ray tracing. It does this by calculating the quasi-invariants of the device at each gradient surface and for the material inbetween.
